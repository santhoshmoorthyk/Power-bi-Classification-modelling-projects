Customer Churn Analysis Report

1\. Overview



This report analyzes customer churn using subscription, usage, sales, and tenure data.

The objective is to understand how many customers are churning, how much revenue is lost, and which customer segments are most affected.



The analysis is built using Power BI, with separate pages for summary and detailed churn behavior.



2\. Key Metrics Summary (Page 1)



* Total Customers: 440.83K
* Total Sales: 278M
* Churned Customers: 250K
* Churn Rate: 56.71%
* Total Sales from Churned Customers: 135M
* Total Sales from Non-Churn Customers: 143M

This shows that more than half of the customers have churned, which is a major business concern.



3\. Revenue Impact of Churn



Out of total sales (278M):



* Churned customers contribute 135M (≈48.6%)
* Non-churn customers contribute 143M (≈51.4%)



Although non-churn customers generate slightly higher revenue, revenue loss due to churn is very significant.

This means churn is affecting not only customer count but also business revenue.



4\. Churn vs Non-Churn Customer Distribution



* Churned Customers: 250K (56.71%)
* Non-Churn Customers: 191K (43.29%)



The customer base is skewed toward churn, indicating poor customer retention.



5\. Contract Length Analysis



Churn behavior varies strongly by contract length:



* Monthly contracts show the highest churn rate
* Annual contracts have comparatively lower churn
* Quarterly contracts fall in between



This suggests that short-term contracts increase churn risk, while longer commitments improve retention.



6\. Usage Frequency Analysis (Page 2)



Usage frequency shows a clear pattern:



* Churned customers have lower usage frequency
* Non-churn customers show higher and more consistent usage



This indicates that reduced engagement is a strong indicator of churn.

Customers who use the service less frequently are more likely to leave.



7\. Churned Customer Sales Trend (Monthly)



Monthly churned customer sales show fluctuations, but overall:



* Revenue loss occurs consistently every month
* Churn is not a one-time issue, but an ongoing problem



This highlights the need for continuous retention strategies, not one-time fixes.



8\. Subscription Type and Churn



Churn rate by subscription type:



* Basic: 58.18%
* Standard: 56.07%
* Premium: 55.94%



Churn is high across all subscription types, with slightly higher churn in Basic plans.

This suggests pricing or perceived value may influence churn.



9\. Tenure-Based Churn Analysis



Churn rate by tenure group:



* 0–6 months: Highest churn
* 6–12 months: Moderate churn
* 1–2 years: Lower churn
* 2+ years: Lowest churn



This clearly shows that early-stage customers are most likely to churn.

Improving onboarding and early engagement can significantly reduce churn.



10\. Key Insights



* More than 56% of customers are churning
* Nearly half of total revenue is at risk
* Low usage frequency strongly correlates with churn
* Monthly contracts and early tenure customers are highest risk
* Churn affects all subscription types, not just one segment



11\. Business Recommendations



* Improve early customer onboarding
* Encourage customers to move from monthly to annual contracts
* Track usage frequency and proactively engage low-usage customers
* Focus retention strategies on first 6 months of customer lifecycle



12\. Conclusion



Customer churn is a critical issue affecting both customer base and revenue.

By focusing on usage behavior, contract structure, and early-tenure engagement, the business can significantly reduce churn and improve long-term growth.
